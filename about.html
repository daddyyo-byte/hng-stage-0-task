          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Dami Bakare, a passionate software developer dedicated to
            creating meaningful and accessible web experiences. My journey into
            tech began with a curiosity about how things work on the internet,
            and it has evolved into a commitment to building solutions that make
            a difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in the power of clean code, thoughtful design, and
            continuous learning. Every project is an opportunity to grow, and
            every challenge is a chance to innovate. Beyond coding, I'm deeply
            interested in the human side of technology—how we can use our skills
            to create inclusive digital spaces that serve everyone.

          <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
          <p>
            Participating in this program represents a significant step in my
            development journey. Here are my key goals:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Master Modern Web Development</h3>
              <p>
                I want to deepen my understanding of frontend and backend
                technologies, learning not just how to write code, but how to
                write scalable, maintainable, and performant applications.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Build Real-World Projects</h3>
              <p>
                Theory is important, but practical experience is invaluable. I
                aim to create projects that solve real problems and can be
                showcased in my portfolio to demonstrate my skills to potential
                employers or clients.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Collaborate and Network</h3>
              <p>
                I'm excited to connect with fellow developers, learn from their
                experiences, and contribute to a supportive community.
                Collaboration often leads to the best learning outcomes.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Enhance Problem-Solving Skills</h3>
              <p>
                Every bug, every challenge is an opportunity to improve my
                analytical thinking and approach to problem-solving. I want to
                become more confident in tackling complex technical issues.
              </p>

          <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
          <p>
            Growth requires honesty about where we need improvement. Here are
            areas where I'm still building confidence:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Backend Architecture</h3>
              <p>
                While I'm comfortable with frontend development, designing
                scalable backend systems with proper database optimization and
                API architecture is still a learning area for me.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Testing and Test-Driven Development</h3>
              <p>
                I understand the importance of testing, but writing
                comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests is
                something I need more practice with. TDD is a mindset I'm
                working to fully adopt.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
              <p>
                While I can build functional applications, optimizing them for
                speed and efficiency—especially at scale—is an area I want to
                master better.

          <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Dear Future Me,</p>
            <p>
              Remember when you first started this journey and everything felt
              overwhelming? Look at how far you've come. Every bug you've
              solved, every feature you've built, every line of code you've
              written has brought you to this moment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep that curiosity alive. The tech world moves fast, but you've
              proven you can adapt and learn. Don't compare your chapter 1 to
              someone else's chapter 20. Your journey is unique, and that's your
              strength.
            </p>
            <p>
              When things get tough—and they will—remember why you started.
              Remember the excitement of seeing your first webpage come to life,
              the satisfaction of fixing that impossible bug, the pride of
              helping someone with your code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Be kind to yourself. Rest when you need to. Celebrate small wins.
              Share what you learn. And never forget: you belong in tech just as
              much as anyone else.
            </p>
            <p>Keep coding, keep learning, keep growing.</p>
            <p>
              With gratitude,<br />
              Your Past Self
            </p>

          <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Technology is more than just code—it's about people. As I progress
            in my career, I'm increasingly aware of the responsibility we have
            as developers to create accessible, inclusive, and ethical
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about web accessibility because I believe the
            internet should be usable by everyone, regardless of their
            abilities. Every project I work on, I ask myself: "Who might I be
            excluding with this design or implementation?" This mindset has made
            me a better developer and a more empathetic person.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also excited about the intersection of technology and education.
            I believe in paying it forward—sharing knowledge, mentoring others,
            and contributing to open source. The developer community has given
            me so much, and I want to give back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I'm learning to balance ambition with patience. Growth
            isn't always linear, and that's okay. Some days I feel like I can
            conquer any coding challenge; other days, basic syntax feels
            overwhelming. Both experiences are part of the journey, and I'm
            learning to embrace them all.
